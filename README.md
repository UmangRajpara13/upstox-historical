# Backtest NSE historical data using Upstox API 📊💻

## Overview

Hammer.js is a Node.js script that fetches historical stock market data for all NSE-listed stocks over the past year, detects hammer candlestick patterns formed at the 30-day low, and logs the relevant details into an Excel sheet. This tool aims to assist in developing and refining trading setups. 📈📉

While Hammer.js serves as an example implementation, users are encouraged to modify the script to detect other candlestick patterns and devise their own trading strategies. 💡

## Features ✨

- Fetches historical daily candlestick data for one year for all NSE stocks.
- Identifies hammer candlestick patterns formed at the 30-day low. 📍
- Logs the following details into an Excel sheet:
  - 📅 Date of the hammer candlestick formation.
  - 🏷️ Instrument name.
  - 📊 Additional columns for analysis to support trading strategies.

## Requirements 🛠️
